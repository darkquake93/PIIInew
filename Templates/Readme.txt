Templates: Templates for documents used in the design and development process. You have been provided with the key ones. Note these should be saved as text files, binary files don't work well with GIT. The word documents that you have been given are in RTF format - which is a text format however the version managed differences are likely to not work well in GIT but the documents are required.
